# Define resource identity

{/*

This is just a rough idea of all the document changes I think we'll want to make.
We can slowly chip away at these and iterate, feel free to add anything I missed!

We will want to include a similar amount of information in SDKv2's documentation, although the
structure is a smaller/simpler, so maybe all the content mentioned below will go on a single page.

*/}

- Under Resource section in Framework
	- New Identity page (one page should probably be fine? We can break into multiple if we feel like it gets too long)
		- Describe the concept of identity (a lot of this can be pulled from the RFCs, either Core's or ours)
			- What is an identity?
			- What data should go into an identity? How will that data be used?
			- What types can you use?
			- What constraints are applied to identity data? (i.e. immutability, must be fully known/non-null, etc.)
			- Any other concepts of identity that provider developers should know
		- Describe and show examples of when identity data should be set
			- One code example is fine, then mention the methods it's available on
				- Create => set identity data
				- Update => likely don't set identity data, maybe mention it exists?
				- Read => set identity data (for import), maybe mention immutability again
				- Delete => identity data
				- MoveResource
		- Describe and show examples of when identity data can be retrieved
			- One code example is fine, then mention methods it's available on
				- Create, Update, Read, Delete
				- MoveResource
		- Link to import resource state page, which we will update with identity info (see below)
	- Update import state page
		- Describe and show example of importing by identity
			- Describe the new requiredforimport and optionalforimport fields
				- Mention that all identity attributes provided in configuration do not need to be exactly retained. Can be looked up in provider configuration
			- Mention usage of stub state vs. identity
				- It's valid to use just identity and keep state null, but it's likely they'll just want to move data from identity to the stub state during Import so their refresh logic can always use a single source of truth to run.
					- Mention new helper for single attribute in identity, show example
		- Add an example of multiple identity attributes updating import stub state
	- Add new upgrade identity page
		- This can basically be a copy/paste of the existing upgrade state page
	- Update MoveResource page
		- Just need to reference that identity can be moved as well as state. Maybe add to the existing example instead of creating a brand new one.
- Update all Attribute pages in framework
	- Mention new identity schema and mention behaviors in a different section?
		- Currently we share a lot of the docs for all attribute types, may need to slightly adjust to accommodate the new schemas.
