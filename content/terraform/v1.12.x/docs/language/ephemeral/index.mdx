# Ephemeral block reference

Ephemeral resources are Terraform resources that are essentially temporary. Ephemeral resources have a unique lifecycle, and Terraform does not store them in its state. Each `ephemeral` block describes one or more ephemeral resources, such as a temporary password or connection to another system.

-> **Note**: Ephemeral resources are available in Terraform v1.10 and later.

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an `ephemeral` resource is different from other resources and data sources. Terraform performs the following lifecycle steps for each ephemeral resource in a configuration:

1. If Terraform needs to access the result of an ephemeral resource, it opens
that ephemeral resource. For example, if Terraform opens an ephemeral resource for a Vault secret, the Vault provider obtains a lease and returns the secret.

1. If Terraform needs access to the ephemeral resource for longer than the
remote system's enforced expiration time, Terraform asks the provider
to periodically renew it. For example, if Terraform renews a Vault secret `ephemeral` resource, the Vault provider calls Vault's lease renewal API endpoint to extend the expiration time.

1. Once Terraform no longer needs an ephemeral resource, Terraform closes
it. This happens after the providers that depend on an ephemeral resource
complete all of their work for the current Terraform run phase. For example, closing a Vault secret ephemeral resource means the Vault provider explicitly ends the lease, allowing Vault to immediately revoke the associated credentials.

## Dependency graph

Ephemeral resources form nodes in Terraform's dependency graph, which interact similarly as resources and data sources. For example, when a resource or data source depends on an attribute of an ephemeral resource, Terraform automatically provisions the ephemeral resource first.

## Configuration model

Most of the arguments within the body of an `ephemeral` block are specific to the ephemeral resource you are defining. As with resources and data sources, each provider in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) includes documentation for the ephemeral resources it supports, if any. An ephemeral resource type's documentation lists which arguments are available and how you should format your resource's values.

The following list outlines general field hierarchy, language-specific data types, and requirements in the `ephemeral` block.

- [`ephemeral`](#ephemeral): map
  - [`attributes`](#ephemeral)
  - [`meta-arguments`](#ephemeral)

## Complete configuration

An `ephemeral` block has the following form:

```hcl
ephemeral "<resource_type>" "<resource_name>" {
  <attributes>
  <meta-arguments>
}
```

## Referencing ephemeral resources

You can only reference ephemeral resources in specific ephemeral contexts or
Terraform throws an error. The following are valid contexts for referencing
ephemeral resources:

* In another ephemeral resource
* In [local values](/terraform/language/block/locals)
* In [ephemeral variables](/terraform/language/block/variable#ephemeral)
* In [ephemeral outputs](/terraform/language/block/output#ephemeral)
* Configuring providers in the `provider` block
* In [provisioner](/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) and [connection](/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/connection) blocks

## Meta-arguments

You can use the following meta-arguments with ephemeral resources to change the behavior of those resources. The following meta-arguments work the same way for resources, data sources, and ephemeral
resources:

- [`depends_on`, for specifying hidden dependencies](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on)
- [`count`, for creating multiple resource instances according to a count](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count)
- [`for_each`, to create multiple instances according to a map or set of strings](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each)
- [`provider`, for selecting a non-default provider configuration](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/resource-provider)
- [`lifecycle`, for lifecycle customizations](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)

Ephemeral resources do not support the `provisioner` meta-argument.

## Example

The following example configures the `postgresql` provider with credentials from
an ephemeral resource. Since these credentials are managed by an ephemeral resource, Terraform does not store them in your state or plan files.

```hcl
ephemeral "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_master" {
  secret_id = data.aws_db_instance.example.master_user_secret[0].secret_arn
}

locals {
  credentials = jsondecode(ephemeral.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_master.secret_string)
}

provider "postgresql" {
  host     = data.aws_db_instance.example.address
  port     = data.aws_db_instance.example.port
  username = local.credentials["username"]
  password = local.credentials["password"]
}
```
