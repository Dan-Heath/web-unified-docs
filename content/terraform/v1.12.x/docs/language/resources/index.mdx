# Resources overview


Add `resource` blocks to your Terraform configuration to create infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records. This topic provides overview information about how to create resources in Terraform. 

For information about configuring a `resource` block, refer to your provider documentation as well as the [`resource` block reference](/terraform/language/block/resource). The `resource` block reference describes the native Terraform [meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) you can set in the `resource` block.

For information about the standard Terraform workflow, refer to [How does Terraform work?](/terraform/intro#how-does-terraform-work)

## How Terraform applies a configuration

When you apply a configuration, Terraform performs the following operations:

1. Create resources that exist in the configuration but are not associated with a real infrastructure object in the state.
1. Destroy resources that exist in the state but no longer exist in the configuration.
1. Update any resources in place if their arguments have changed.
1. Destroy and re-create resources whose arguments have changed but cannot be updated in-place due to remote API limitations.

Terraform applies this process for all resources, regardless of type, but the details are specific to each resource type. 

## State

Terraform stores identifiers for real objects it manages in a [state file](/terraform/language/state) named `terraform.tfstate`. This file is the source of truth for the infracture you manage with Terraform. To modify the state of your infrastructure, update the Terraform configuration and run a `terraform apply` command. 

For `resource` blocks that already manage an infrastructure object in the state, Terraform compares the actual configuration of the object with the arguments given in the configuration and makes any necessary updates so that the object matches the configuration.

## Configuration

Each `resource` block describes one or more infrastructure objects. In most cases, you should refer to your provider documentation for guidance on how to define resources. The following topics provide describe required resource configurations and common configuration patterns.       

### Resource type

You must declare a type for each `resource` block you add to your configuration. The type determines the kind of infrastructure object it manages and what arguments and other attributes the resource supports. Most resource types are implemented by your provider, but Terraform includes a native resource type, [`terraform_data`](/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data), that you can use to create resources for specialized use cases. 

### Provider 

[Providers](/terraform/language/providers/requirements) are plugins for Terraform that offer a collection of resource types managing a single cloud or on-premises infrastructure platform. Providers are distributed separately from Terraform, but Terraform can automatically install most providers when initializing a working directory.

To manage resources, a Terraform module must specify the required providers. Refer to 
[Provider requirements](/terraform/language/providers/requirements) for more information.

Most providers require you to configure authentication settings, version requirements, or other arguments to access their remote APIs. Terraform expects provider configuration in the root module. Refer to [Provider configuration](/terraform/language/providers/configuration) for more information.

Terraform providers write and maintain their own documentation, which describes its resource
types and arguments. Refer to the public [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) for all publicly-available provider documentation.

Note that provider documentation is versioned to match the provider. Verify that you are viewing the correct documentation for your provider version.

### Arguments

Most of the arguments within the body of a `resource` block are specific to the
selected resource type. The resource type's documentation lists which arguments
are available and how their values should be formatted.

You can use Terraform [expressions](/terraform/language/expressions) and other dynamic Terraform
language features to configure resource arugment values. 

### Meta-arguments

The Terraform language also includes built-in arguments called [meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) that you can use with any resource type. Meta-arguments configure how Terraform creates and manages resources. The following examples describe some of the meta-arguments you can use in your `resource` blocks.

#### Custom condition checks

Add `precondition` and `postcondition` blocks to specify assumptions and guarantees about how the resource operates. These blocks can help future maintainers understand the configuration design and intent. They also return useful 
information about errors earlier and in context so that consumers can diagnose issues in their configuration. Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/test-and-validate/validate) for instructions on creating custom condition checks.  

#### Multiple provider configurations

Terraform uses a resource type's name to determine which provider to use. 
By convention, resource type names start with their provider's preferred local name.
You can declare multiple provider configurations in your configuration and configure each resource to use a different configuration. When using multiple configurations, you must use [the `provider` meta-argument](/terraform/language/block/resource#provider) to manually choose a provider configuration.

#### Specify resource dependencies

Terraform makes most changes to several unrelated resources in parallel and automatically manages dependencies. Terraform analyses any [expressions](/terraform/language/expressions) within a `resource` block to find references to other objects and treats those references as the implicit order requirements when creating, updating, or destroying resources. Because most resources with
behavioral dependencies on other resources also refer to those resources' data,
you do not usually need to manually specify dependencies between resources.

Occasionally, you may need to instruct Terraform to create some resources after others, such as when a resource's configuration requires information generated by another resource and Terraform is unable to implicitly determine dependencies in the configuration. For
example, if Terraform must manage access control policies and take actions
that require those policies to be present, there is a hidden dependency between
the access policy and a resource whose creation depends on it. In these rare
cases, use the [`depends_on` meta-argument](/terraform/language/block/resource#depends_on)
to explicitly specify a dependency.

You can also use the [`replace_triggered_by` meta-argument](/terraform/language/block/resource#replace_triggered_by) to add dependencies between otherwise independent resources. This argument forces Terraform to replace the parent resource when there is a change to a referenced resource or resource attribute.

### Operation timeouts

Some resource types provide include a `timeouts` argument that lets you to customize how long certain operations are allowed to take before being considered to have failed.
For example, [`aws_db_instance`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_instance)
allows configurable timeouts for `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations.

Timeouts are handled entirely by the resource type implementation in the
provider, but resource types offering these features follow the convention
of defining a child block called `timeouts` that has a nested argument
named after each operation that has a configurable timeout value.
Each of these arguments takes a string representation of a duration, such
as `"60m"` for 60 minutes, `"10s"` for ten seconds, or `"2h"` for two hours.

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  # ...

  timeouts {
    create = "60m"
    delete = "2h"
  }
}
```

The set of configurable operations is chosen by each resource type. Most
resource types do not support the `timeouts` block at all. Consult the
documentation for each resource type to see which operations it offers
for configuration, if any.

### Access resource attributes

You can use [expressions](/terraform/language/expressions) in a Terraform module to access
information about resources in the same module.  and you can use that information
to help configure other resources. Use the `<RESOURCE TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>`
syntax to reference a resource attribute in an expression.

In addition to arguments specified in the configuration, resources often provide
read-only attributes with information obtained from the remote API; this often
includes things that can't be known until the resource is created, like the
resource's unique random ID.

Many providers also include [data sources](/terraform/language/data-sources),
which are a special type of resource used only for looking up information.

For a list of the attributes a resource or data source type provides, consult
its documentation; these are generally included in a second list below its list
of configurable arguments.

For more information about referencing resource attributes in expressions, see
[Expressions: References to Resource Attributes](/terraform/language/expressions/references#references-to-resource-attributes).

### Local-only Resources

While most resource types correspond to an infrastructure object type that
is managed via a remote network API, there are certain specialized resource
types that operate only within Terraform itself, calculating some results and
saving those results in the state for future use.

For example, local-only resource types exist for
[generating private keys](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls/latest/docs/resources/private_key),
[issuing self-signed TLS certificates](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls/latest/docs/resources/self_signed_cert),
and even [generating random ids](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/id).
While these resource types often have a more marginal purpose than those
managing "real" infrastructure objects, they can be useful as glue to help
connect together other resources.

The behavior of local-only resources is the same as all other resources, but
their result data exists only within the Terraform state. "Destroying" such
a resource means only to remove it from the state, discarding its data.
