# Remove a resource from state

You can either use the `removed` block or the Terraform CLI to remove a resource from your state file without destroying the actual infrastructure it represents. Add the `removed` block when you want to remove multiple resources from state at once and review your changes before they take effect. You can only remove one resource at a time using the Terraform CLI.

When you remove a resource from state, Terraform no longer manages the corresponding resource in your cloud provider. If you wish to resume managing the resource with Terraform, you must import the resource back into your configuration. Refer to [Import existing resources](/terraform/language/import) for more information.

Refer to the following topics for more information:

- [Destroy a resource](/terraform/language/resources/destroy) provides instructions on how to remove a resource from state and destroy the actual infrastructure.
- [Refactor modules](/terraform/language/modules/refactor) provides instructions on refactoring reusable modules. 

## Requirements

Terraform v1.7 and later is required to use the `removed` block. For earlier Terraform versions, you must [use the Terraform CLI](#use-the-terraform-cli).
## Use a `removed` block

1. Replace the `resource` block from your configuration with a [`removed` block](/terraform/language/block/removed) and configure the following arguments:

  - Specify the address of the resource you want to remove in the `from` argument. You cannot include instance keys, such as `"aws_instance.example[1]"`, if the resource is configured to provision multiple instances.
  - Add a `lifecycle` block to the `removed` block and set the `destroy` argument to `false`. Setting `destroy` to `true` removes the resource from state and destroys it. Refer to [Destroy a resource](TBD) for more information. 

1. Delete any references to the resource's attributes. You can run the `terraform validate` command to find references in your configuration.
1. Run `terraform apply` and confirm that you want to proceed when prompted.
 
The following example removes the `aws_instance.example` resource but does not destroy it:

```hcl
removed {
  from = aws_instance.example

  lifecycle {
    destroy = false
  }
}
```
## Use the Terraform CLI

Run the `terraform state rm` command and specify the address of the resource you want to remove from state. The following example removes all instances of a `packet_device.worker`:

```hcl
$ terraform state rm 'packet_device.worker'
```

You must still remove the resource from your configuration after removing it from state. You must also delete any references to the resource's attributes. You can run the `terraform validate` command to find references in your configuration.

For examples and additional information, refer to the [`terraform state rm` command](/terraform/cli/commands/rm) reference.
