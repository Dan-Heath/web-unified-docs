# Syntax overview

The Terraform language documentation focuses on practical uses of the language and specific constructs. The pages in this section describe the fundamental syntax and structure of the Terraform language.

- [Configuration syntax](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration) describes the native grammar of the Terraform language.
- [JSON configuration syntax](/terraform/language/syntax/json) documents how to represent Terraform language constructs in JSON. Terraform's JSON syntax is unfriendly to humans but can be useful when generating infrastructure as code with other systems that do not have a readily available HCL library.
- [Style conventions](/terraform/language/style#code-formatting) documents commonly accepted formatting guidelines for Terraform code. You can enforce these conventions automatically with [`terraform fmt`](/terraform/cli/commands/fmt).
