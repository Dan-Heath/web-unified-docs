# Files and directories

This section describes the different types of files and directories that Terraform uses to organize and manage your infrastructure configuration.

- [Configuration files](/terraform/language/files/configuration-files) describes the basic structure and organization of Terraform configuration files, including file extensions, text encoding, and how modules organize files and directories.
- [Dependency lock file](/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock) explains how Terraform tracks and selects provider versions using the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file.
- [Override files](/terraform/language/files/override) covers how to use override files to merge additional settings into existing configuration objects.
- [Test files](/terraform/language/files/tests) describes how to write test files for validating your configuration and modules.
