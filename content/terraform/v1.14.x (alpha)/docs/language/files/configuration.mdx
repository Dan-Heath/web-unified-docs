# Configuration files

This page describes the basic structure and organization of Terraform configuration files.

## File extension

Terraform stores code in plain text files with the `.tf` file extension. Terraform also supports
[a JSON-based variant of the language](/terraform/language/syntax/json) with the `.tf.json` file extension.

Files containing Terraform code are called _configuration files._

## Text encoding

Configuration files must use UTF-8 encoding. We recommend you use Unix-style line endings (LF) rather than Windows-style line endings (CRLF), though both work.

## Directories and modules

A _module_ is a collection of `.tf` and/or `.tf.json` files in a directory.

A Terraform module contains only the top-level configuration files in a directory. Nested directories are separate modules and are not automatically included.

Terraform evaluates all configuration files in a module as a single document. You can separate blocks into different files for convenience without affecting the module's behavior.

A Terraform module can use [module calls](/terraform/language/modules) to include other modules. Child modules can come from local directories or external sources like the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io).

## Root module

Terraform runs in the context of a single _root module._ A complete _Terraform configuration_ consists of a root module and all child modules it calls.

- In Terraform CLI, the root module is the working directory where you invoke Terraform. You can use command line options to specify a root module outside the working directory, but this is rare.
- In HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise, the root module defaults to the top level of the configuration directory. You can specify the root module as a subdirectory in the workspace settings.
