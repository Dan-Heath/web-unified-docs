# Manage sensitive data in your configuration

Terraform requires access to sensitive data, such as cloud provider credentials, API tokens, and other secrets to provision your infrastructure. This section describes the different approaches for securing sensitive data in your configuration and the tradeoffs of each approach.

- [Sensitive argument](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/sensitive-argument) shows you how to redact values from CLI output and UI while storing them in state.
- [Ephemeral values](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/ephemeral) shows you how to omit values from state and plan files entirely.
- [Write-only arguments](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only) shows you how to pass temporary values to managed resources without persisting them.
- [State security](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/state-security) contains best practices for securing your state files.

## Background

Terraform state and plan files contain detailed information about your infrastructure, including resource attributes and metadata that can contain sensitive values, such as initial database passwords or API tokens.

If you are developing with Terraform locally, Terraform stores your state in a plaintext file, which includes any secret values you defined in your configuration. Treat your state file as sensitive data by excluding it from Git workflows and following our recommendations to secure your state file.

You can also configure Terraform to store your state and plan files in a remote location. When you configure Terraform to use remote state storage, it only holds state in memory when actively using it. You can encrypt your state at rest, but the encryption method depends on your specific backend. For example, HCP Terraform automatically encrypts state at rest and protects it with TLS in transit.

## Requirements

The following requirements are tied to specific blocks and arguments you can use to handle sensitive values in your Terraform configuration:

- Use Terraform 0.15 or later to add the sensitive argument to variable and output blocks
- Use Terraform 1.10 or later to add the ephemeral argument to variables and child module outputs, or add the ephemeral block
- Use Terraform 1.11 or later to use a write-only argument on a managed resource

Each provider defines available ephemeral blocks and write-only arguments on their managed resources. Refer to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) to learn more about what your provider supports.
