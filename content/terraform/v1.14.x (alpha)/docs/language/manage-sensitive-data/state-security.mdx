# Secure your state files

Terraform state and plan files contain detailed information about your infrastructure, including resource attributes and metadata that can contain sensitive values, such as initial database passwords or API tokens.

If you are developing with Terraform locally, Terraform stores your state in a plaintext file, which includes any secret values you defined in your configuration. Treat your state file as sensitive data by excluding it from Git workflows and following our recommendations for state security.

## State storage options

You can configure Terraform to store your state and plan files in a [remote location](/terraform/language/state/remote). When you configure Terraform to use remote state storage, it only holds state in memory when actively using it. You can encrypt your state at rest, but the encryption method depends on your specific backend.

For example, HCP Terraform automatically encrypts state at rest and protects it with TLS in transit.

## State security best practices

If you store sensitive values in a state file, we recommend implementing additional security measures to keep your state safe: store your state remotely, encrypt your state at rest, use access controls to limit who has access to your state, and use audit logs to track state access over time.

## Backend encryption options

Storing your state remotely can provide better security by letting you encrypt your state when it's at rest. The following backends support state encryption:

- [HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/) encrypts state at rest, lets you [supply your own encryption keys](/terraform/cloud-docs/hold-your-own-key), and protects state with TLS in transit
- The [S3 backend](/terraform/language/backend/s3) can encrypt state at rest if you enable the `encrypt` option, and protects state with TLS in transit
- The GCS backend supports using [customer-supplied](/terraform/language/backend/gcs#customer-supplied-encryption-keys) or [customer-managed](/terraform/language/backend/gcs#customer-managed-encryption-keys-cloud-kms) encryption keys

## Local development considerations

For local development, always exclude your state file from version control by adding it to your `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
# Terraform state files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
.terraform/
```

Consider using a remote backend even for local development to ensure consistent state management across team members.
