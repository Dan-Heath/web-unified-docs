# Provision resources

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Provision Infrastructure Deployed with Terraform](/terraform/tutorials/provision) tutorials to learn how to use provisioners.

You may need to upload files, run commands and scripts, and perform other operations to prepare resources you create and manage with Terraform for service. Terraform is primarily designed for immutable infrastructure operations, so we strongly recommend using purpose-built solutions to provision your resources.

You can use the following methods to prepare a resource for service:

- Pass data to the resource using the [provider's `cloud-init` implementation](/terraform/language/provision/compute).
- Use the [`cloudinit-config` data source](/terraform/language/provision/cloud-config) to pass data to the resource.
- Provision [machine images](/terraform/language/provision/packer) using Packer or configuration management tools.
- Use [provisioners](/terraform/language/provision/provisioners) built into Terraform.

You should exercise extreme caution when using provisioners. Terraform cannot predictably model provisioner behaviors represented in the configuration. Additionally, most provisioners require direct network access to your servers and credentials to install and configure external software, which introduces complexity and potential security issues.
