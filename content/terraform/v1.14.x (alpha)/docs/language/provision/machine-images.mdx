# Configure machine images

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Provision Infrastructure with Packer](/terraform/tutorials/provision/packer) tutorial.

[HashiCorp Packer](/packer) lets you build system configuration steps into custom images. Packer uses configuration management provisioners that can run installation steps during the build process before creating a system disk image that you can reuse.

Configuration management software, like Ansible, uses a centralized server component may require you to register the software as part of the configuration process. You must delay the registration step until the final system is booted from your custom image. 

You can [pass the necessary information to the resource](/terraform/language/provision/compute) to delay registration so that the configuration management software can register itself with the centralized server immediately on boot without requiring the resource to accept commands from Terraform over SSH or WinRM.
