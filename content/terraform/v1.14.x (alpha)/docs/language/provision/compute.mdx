# Pass data into compute resources

When deploying virtual machines or other similar compute resources, you can pass data to the resource. Most cloud computing platforms provide mechanisms to pass data to instances at the time of their creation. This makes the data immediately available on system boot.

## Resource-specific arguments

Refer to the following provider resources for instructions on how to pass data to respective compute resources. Note that you can also specify cloud-config files as values. You can use the `cloudinit_config` data source to render cloud-config files. Refer to the [cloudinit_config documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/cloudinit/latest/docs/data-sources/config) for more information.

| Cloud service | Argument | Resource type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alibaba Cloud | `user_data` | [`alicloud_instance`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aliyun/alicloud/latest/docs/resources/instance), [`alicloud_launch_template`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aliyun/alicloud/latest/docs/resources/launch_template) |
| Amazon EC2 | `user_data`, `user_data_base64` | [`aws_instance`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance), [`aws_launch_template`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/launch_template), [`aws_launch_configuration`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/launch_configuration) |
| Amazon Lightsail | `user_data` | [`aws_lightsail_instance`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lightsail_instance) |
| Microsoft Azure | `custom_data` | [`azurerm_virtual_machine`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_machine), [`azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_machine_scale_set) |
| Google Cloud Platform | `metadata` | [`google_compute_instance`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_instance), [`google_compute_instance_group`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_instance_group) |
| Oracle Cloud Infrastructure | `metadata`, `extended_metadata` |  [`oci_core_instance`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/), [`oci_core_instance_configuration`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/) |
| VMware vSphere | `cdrom` block | Attach a virtual CDROM to [`vsphere_virtual_machine`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/docs/resources/virtual_machine) using the `cdrom` block and specify a file called `user-data.txt` |

## Cloud-init

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Provision Infrastructure with Cloud-Init](/terraform/tutorials/provision/cloud-init) tutorial.

Many Linux distribution disk images include [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which lets you run scripts and configure systems on system boot up. Some providers let you configure cloud-init on the virtual machine's guest operating system. For providers that support cloud-init, the `user_data` and `custom_data` arguments are common methods for passing data. Refer to the provider documentation for details.

In the following example, the `custom_data` argument in the `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine` resource specifies a file containing the data to pass to the resource on startup:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "example" {
  # . . .
  custom_data = base64encode(file("custom-data.sh"))
}
```

If you build custom machine images, you may be able to access the data passed to the resource using `user_data` or `metadata` at runtime. Refer to your vendor's documentation for more information.

This approach is required when you use your cloud provider to automatically launch and destroy servers in a group because individual servers will launch unattended when Terraform is not available to provision them.

Even if you're deploying individual servers directly with Terraform, using `user_data` or `metadata` to pass data allows for faster boot times. It also simplifies deployment by avoiding the need for direct network access from Terraform to the new server and for remote access credentials to be provided.
