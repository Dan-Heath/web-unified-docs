# `issensitive` Function

-> **Note:** This function is only available in Terraform v1.8 and later.

`issensitive` takes any value and returns true if Terraform
treats it as sensitive, with the same meaning and behavior as for
[sensitive input variables](/terraform/language/reference/block/variable#sensitive).

If a value not marked as sensitive is passed the function returns false.

See [`sensitive`](/terraform/language/reference/functions/sensitive), [`nonsensitive`](/terraform/language/reference/functions/nonsensitive), and [sensitive input variables](/terraform/language/reference/block/variable#sensitive) for more information on sensitive values.

## Examples

```
> issensitive(sensitive("secret"))
true
> issensitive("hello")
false
> issensitive(var.my-var-with-sensitive-set-to-true)
true
```
