### Identity system duplicate cleanup ((#dedupe)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

<!-- BEGIN: Vault:=v1.19.x -->

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | Enterprise

<!-- END: Vault:=v1.19.x -->

Vault 1.19.0 includes a feature flag that, when enabled, forces deduplication of
existing identities and forbids duplicate identities going forward. Once
activated, the deduplication feature corrects historical identity bugs with a
one-time deduplication process and restores Vault to secure, default behavior.

Vault does not enforce deduplication until you activate the relevant feature
flag.

#### Recommendation

Vault 1.19.0 also includes improved reporting in server logs to help diagnose
whether you have duplicate identities in your Vault instance.

After upgrading, review your server logs for identity duplicate reporting.

refer to the [resolve duplicate identities](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication)
guides to understand deduplication log messages, determine if you need to take
action, make the necessary updates, and ensure the forced deduplication process
resolves safely.
