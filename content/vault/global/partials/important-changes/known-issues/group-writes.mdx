### Login/token renewal failures after group changes ((#group-writes))

| Change      | Status | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.19.0           | 1.19.3

Performance standby nodes cannot persist updated group membership to storage.
As a result, standby nodes return a `500` error during login or token renewal if
the external group associated with the client entity changes.

#### Workaround

Direct all logins and token renewals to the active/primary node.
Or upgrade to Vault 1.19.3+
