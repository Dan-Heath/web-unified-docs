### Unwanted secret rotation for DB and LDAP roles on restart ((#secret-rotate-on-restart))

| Change      | Status | Affected version                                 | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.16.x, 1.17.x, 1.18.0 - 1.18.8, 1.19.0 - 1.19.2 | 1.18.9, 1.19.3

Database and LDAP secrets engines both support skipping automatic import
rotation of static roles with the config-level field
`skip_static_role_import_rotation` and the static role-level field
`skip_import_rotation`.

When either field is `true`, Vault automatically rotates the configured static
roles when Vault restarts. Vault skips password rotation if the password was
already rotated before the restart.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to 1.18.9+ or 1.19.3+. If you cannot upgrade, the only workaround is to
avoid restarting the backend.
