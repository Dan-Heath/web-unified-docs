### Writing configuration to local auth mount (ldap, aws, gcp, azure) ignores local flag ((#local-auth-config))

| Change | Affected version | Fixed version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Known issue | 1.19.0 | None |

Vault incorrectly forwards write operations targeting a local authentication
mounts on a performance replication secondary to the primary cluster for
processing. Forwarding the request prevents independent configuration of local
mounts on secondary clusters for the following authentication methods:

- Azure
- GCP
- AWS
- LDAP

Incorrect forwarding leads to two distinct failure modes:

1. If a local auth mount with the same path exists on the primary, Vault
   incorrectly applies the write operation to the primary node mount.

1. If the auth mount path does not exist on the primary, the secondary cluster
   panics with a `nil pointer dereference` error and the Vault node crashes.


#### Recommendation

Do not attempt to configure local auth mounts on performance replication
secondaries.
