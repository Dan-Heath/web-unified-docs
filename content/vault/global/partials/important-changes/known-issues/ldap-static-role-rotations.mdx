### Unexpected LDAP static role rotations on upgrade ((#ldap-static-role-rotations))

| Change      | Status | Affected version                                                       | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.16.16 - 1.16.19, 1.17.12 - 1.17.15, 1.18.5 - 1.18.8, 1.19.0 - 1.19.2 | 1.16.20, 1.17.16, 1.18.9, 1.19.3

Vault automatically rotates existing static roles tied to LDAP credentials once
when upgrading to an affected version. After the one-time rotation, the static
roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround

If you rely on LDAP static roles, upgrade to Vault 1.19.3+, 1.18.9+, 1.17.16+,
or 1.16.20+.
