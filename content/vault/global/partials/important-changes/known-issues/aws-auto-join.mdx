You must have dual stack endpoints enabled for the associated region to autojoin
nodes to a cluster after unsealing Vault.

#### Workaround

Auto join does not work for the affected versions. If you rely on auto join for
your nodes, upgrade to a fixed version or avoid upgrading if you currently use
an unaffected version.
