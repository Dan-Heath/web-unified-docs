### Duplicate LDAP password rotations on standby node check-in ((#ldap-checkin))

<!-- BEGIN: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

| Change      | Status   | Vault edition | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------
| Known issue | Open     | All           | 1.20.0+          | None

<!-- END: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

Performing Vault check-ins for LDAP service accounts on a performance standby
node or nodes in a performance standby cluster can trigger duplicate password
changes on the LDAP server.

Duplication occurs when the LDAP client on the local node successfully modifies
a password before Vault forwards the check-in request to the active node, which
then performs a second password update.

While users still receive the latest password, the secondary update may lead to
unexpected LDAP activity and cause confusion interpreting audit logs.

#### Recommendation

Send check-in requests directly to the active node of the primary cluster to
prevent duplicate password rotations on the LDAP server.
