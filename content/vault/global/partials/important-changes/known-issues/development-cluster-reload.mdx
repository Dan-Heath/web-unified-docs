### Secondary cluster reload overwrites development cluster setting ((#development-cluster-reload)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

<!-- BEGIN: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

| Change      | Status   | Vault edition | Affected versions | Fixed version
| ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------- | -------------
| Known issue | Resolved | Enterprise    | 1.20.0            | 1.20.1

<!-- END: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

If the Vault process receives a `SIGHUP` and reloads a secondary performance
replication cluster, the cluster reverts to the locally configured
`development_cluster` value instead of following the value configured on the
primary cluster.

#### Recommendation

Ensure all clusters in a performance replication group have the same
`development_cluster` value configured in HCL to prevent unexpected changes to
the reported value.
