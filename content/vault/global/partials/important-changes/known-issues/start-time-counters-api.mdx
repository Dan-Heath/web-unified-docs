### Counters API requires start time in Vault Community ((#start-time-counters-api))

| Change      | Status | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.18.x, 1.19.x   | 1.20.0

Vault Community requires the `start_time` parameter  for
`/sys/internal/counters/activity`. Unlike Enterprise Vault, Vault Commuity does
not define a billing start time, and ommitting `start_time` may lead to
unexpected behavior in affected versions (1.18.x and 1.19.x). 

You can safely omit `start_time` for Vault Enterprise as `start_time` defaults
to the billing start date for the cluster.

#### Workaround

To avoid issues and unexpected behavior with Vault Community, always provide a
valid `start_time` value when calling `/sys/internal/counters/activity` or
upgrade to v1.20.x.
