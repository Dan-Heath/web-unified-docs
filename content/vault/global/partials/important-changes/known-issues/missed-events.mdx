Users may miss events when multiple clients subscribe to the same performance
standby node in a cluster with the same namespace and event type filters because
one client disconnecting effectively unsubscribes the remaining clients who no
longer receive events.

#### Recommendation

If you have multiple event subscribers with the same namespace and event type
filters you have two options:

1. Spread them out among the nodes of the Vault cluster.
1. Only subscribe to events on the active node of the cluster.
