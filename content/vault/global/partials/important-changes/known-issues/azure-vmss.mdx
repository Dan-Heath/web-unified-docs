### Azure authentication fails to authenticate Uniform VMSS instances ((#azure-vmss))

| Change       | Affected version                                               | Fixed version
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.16.18-1.16.20, 1.17.14-1.17.16, 1.18.7-1.18.9, 1.19.1-1.19.3 | 1.16.21, 1.17.17, 1.18.10, 1.19.4

A previous update to validate JWT claims against the provided VM, VMSS, and
resource group names without accounting for the uniform VMSS format introduced a
regression that causes Azure authentication from a uniform VMSS instance with a
user assigned managed identity on the VMSS to incorrectly return an error.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to one of the following Vault versions: 1.16.21+, 1.17.17+, 1.18.10+,
1.19.4+
