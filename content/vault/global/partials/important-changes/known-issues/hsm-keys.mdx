In HSM-HA configurations migrating from Shamir to HSM-backed unseal/seal wraps,
Vault may create duplicate HSM keys when you migrate from Shamir to an
HSM-backed unseal configuration for high availability (HA) HSM deployments. Key
duplication can happen even after a seal migration to HSM that initially
appears successful.

Duplicate HSM keys can cause the following errors:

- intermittent read failures with errors like `CKR_SIGNATURE_INVALID` and
  `CKR_KEY_HANDLE_INVALID` for [seal-wrapped values](/vault/docs/enterprise/sealwrap#wrapped-parameters).
- nodes fail to unseal after a restart with errors such as `CKR_DATA_INVALID`.

#### Recommendation

Always run Vault with `generate_key = false` and manually create all required
keys within the HSM during the setup process.
