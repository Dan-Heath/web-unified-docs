### Full seal rewraps occur on DR/PR failover with multi-seal enabled ((#multi-seal-rewrap)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

<!-- BEGIN: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

| Change      | Status   | Vault edition | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------
| Known issue | Open     | Enterprise    | 1.20.0+          | None

<!-- END: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

When Vault fails over to a DR or performance cluster with
`enable_multiseal = true`, Vault performs a full rewrap, which can lead to
performance degradation until the rewrap operation completes.

#### Recommendation

Disable multi-seal support.
