### GUI login fails for auth mounts with underscores and unauthenticated listing ((#ui-login-underscore))

<!-- BEGIN: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

| Change      | Status   | Vault edition | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------
| Known issue | Resolved | All           | 1.20.0           | 1.20.1

<!-- END: Vault:=v1.20.x -->

Login requests to auth methods mounted at paths using underscores (e.g. `oidc_test`)
with `listing_visibility="unauth"` fail because the GUI calls the wrong
endpoint. Mounts with dashes (e.g. `oidc-test`) work correctly.


#### Recommendation

As a workaround, you can log in to the GUI using the following steps:

1. Navigate directly to the URL for the desired method type (e.g. `${VAULT_ADDR}/ui/vault/auth?with=oidc`)
1. Click "Sign in with other methods &rarr;"
1. Select the method type from the dropdown
1. Click **Advanced settings** and provide the correct path (e.g., `oidc_test`).

We also recommend creating a [custom GUI message](/vault/docs/ui/custom-messages)
describing the workaround steps for users.
