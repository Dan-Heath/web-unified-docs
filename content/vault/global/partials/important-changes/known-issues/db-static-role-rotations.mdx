### Unexpected DB static role rotations on upgrade ((#db-static-role-rotations))

| Change      | Status | Affected version                                                        | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.16.16 - 1.16.19, 1.17.12 - 1.17.15, 1.18.5 - 1.18.8, 1.19.0 - 1.19.2  | 1.16.20, 1.17.16, 1.18.9, 1.19.3

Any database static role that was created prior to Vault 1.15.0 will be affected upon upgrading to the affected Vault versions.
Vault will automatically rotate static database credentials once, for all roles created prior to 1.15.0, when upgrading to affected versions.
After the one-time rotation, the static roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to 1.19.3+, 1.18.9+, 1.17.16, 1.16.20+
