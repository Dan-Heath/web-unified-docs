# Monitor network traffic

The network communication between your services can become very complex, especially if your applications communicate with several other internal services. Network stability and troubleshooting are a complex topic, but discovering where your services are running in a dynamic service architecture can also be challenging.

If you use a network service to manage communication between your services, such as HashiCorp's Consul, you should maintain a list of troubleshooting steps that can help you quickly resolve any issues that arise. Troubleshooting service-to-service communication can be especially complicated when you have many services all communicating with each other. In these situations, a visualization of your network's health can help quickly identify issues in your distributed services.
