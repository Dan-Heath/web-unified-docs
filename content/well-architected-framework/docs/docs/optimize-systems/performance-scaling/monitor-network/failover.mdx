# Plan for failover

As important as it is to plan for performance degradation in your infrastructure, it's just as important to have a plan for unexpectedly losing critical infrastructure. 

Load balancers can help the stability of your applications in two ways. First, they spread the load to your application across multiple instances, reducing the load on any single instance. Second, some load balancers have built-in health checks. If an instance fails, the load balancer will stop sending traffic to that instance. You can use Terraform to manage load balancers in all major cloud providers, such as the [`aws_lb`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb) resource in AWS, the [`azurerm_lb`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/lb) resource in Azure, and the [`google_compute_forwarding_rule`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_forwarding_rule) in GCP.
You can also create multi-region and multi-cloud deployments with Terraform. 

Additionally, you can use a service discovery and service mesh solution like Consul and its internal DNS to ensure your application only sends requests to healthy instances without needing to route all the way up to the load balancer and back down. Consul also automatically routes requests to services as they dynamically spin up and shut down, or otherwise become unresponsive.

Terraform lets you reuse your configuration to set up multi-region and multi-cloud deployments. With Stacks, you can roll out the same configuration from testing environments, to staging, to production, ensuring that your infrastructure changes are stable and production-ready.
