# Automatically detect resource drift and health

There may be times when you or someone else makes changes to your infrastructure manually, causing your actual state to no longer match your Terraform configuration. For example, a teammate can manually update your infrastructure, or your cloud provider can automatically update a resource. This can often cause issues when you go to update your configuration. This difference between your Terraform state and real-world resources is called "drift".

You can also write custom conditions in Terraform to validate your resources with custom logic. For example, if your Terraform configuration deploys a web application, you can write a custom condition to send an HTTP request to the application and ensure it returns a healthy response. 

HCP Terraform can run periodic refresh-only Terraform plans to automatically detect drift and run your custom conditions. You can configure these health checks on individual workspaces. When HCP Terraform detects drift, you can choose to either run a new Terraform apply, or update your configuration to match the new state.
