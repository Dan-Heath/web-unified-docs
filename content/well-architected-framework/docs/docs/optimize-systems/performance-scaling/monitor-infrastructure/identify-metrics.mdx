# Identify common metrics

Choose infrastructure and service metrics that match your monitoring goals so that you can understand how healthy your infrastructure and services are. This proactive approach lets you quickly fix any problems, improve performance, and provide a smooth experience for your users.

Common metrics include:
  - CPU usage
  - memory utilization
  - disk I/O
  - network traffic
  - server uptime

Common metrics include:
  - response times
  - error rates
  - throughput
  - latency

Analyzing infrastructure and service metrics helps you prevent issues like bottlenecks, congestion, and paying for excess unused capacity. The following examples show how different infrastructure and service metrics contribute to different insights and actions you may need to take.

To optimize performance, monitor these key metrics:
  - Infrastructure metrics:
    - CPU usage: High CPU usage can signal performance issues.
    - Memory utilization: High memory usage can signal a need for more memory resources.
  - Service metrics:
    - Response times: Slow response times help you identify and address bottlenecks. Response times measure how quickly services respond to users.

For capacity planning, monitor these key metrics:
  - Infrastructure metrics:
    - Disk I/O - High disk I/O can signal storage bottlenecks.
    - Network traffic: Dynamic traffic levels let you scale up resources during times when you expect the most traffic, and scale down when you expect lower levels of traffic.
  - Service metrics:
    - Service throughput: High throughput levels can signal sufficient capacity since services can sustain performance when they receive more traffic.
