# Scale servers

As the load on your application grows, the infrastructure resources it uses also grows. It is important to know how your application's resource usage grows over time so that you can develop a strategy early to scale the resources behind it.

Autoscaling enables you to add or remove infrastructure resources based on a set of metrics. The metric could be that the average CPU utilization is above a predefined threshold, or it could trigger based on application-specific metrics such as average response time or queue depth.

Many cloud providers provide the ability to create autoscaling groups, and you can create these groups programmatically with Terraform. Refer to the provider's documentation for more information.
