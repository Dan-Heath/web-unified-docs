# Rotate expired certificates

We recommend that you define a consistent TTL for every certificate in your infrastructure and automatically rotate your certificates prior to their expiration. When implementing automatic certificate rotation, set up your alerting solution to notify you before your certificates are invalid in case services or infrastructure fails to reload the new certificate. You can apply the process of handling an expired certificate to other  situations, such as revoking a certificate outside of your usual rotation cycle. If a certificate is compromised, a private key is leaked, or other security incidents, having a solution to quickly revoke the certificate and issue a new one can help lessen downtime and increase security.

HashiCorp Vault can manage, issue, rotate, and revoke certificates throughout your infrastructure. You can also use the Vault Agent to automatically make requests on behalf of the client application. This means once you reissue a certificate, the Vault Agent automatically makes it available to your application. You can use Vault Agent's reload capability to restart the service to use the new certificates or build the reload into the application.

You can use the Vault Agent to supervise a specific process and take actions related to that process. For example, if you use the Vault Agent with MongoDB, the agent can restart the service or send a signal to the process to reload the configuration after it obtains a new TLS certificate.

### Seal Vault during a security incident

In the case of a security incident, it can be important to lock down your most sensitive services such as Vault until the issue is resolved. Incidents such as credential leakage, intrusion, or denial-of-service attacks mean that timely mitigation is top priority. Vault provides two features to help you lock the service down until you resolve the incident:

- **Seal**: Vault discards its in-memory key to unlock data, preventing it from responding to any request to access secrets.
- **API Lock**: If you do not require Vault to be entirely sealed, you can instead lock the API for individual namespaces.

After a security incident, it's important to review what caused it, and invalidate any compromised credentials. Boundary provides audit logging and session recording, giving you valuable insight into how an attacker gained access to your infrastructure. Vault Radar automatically detects and identifies unmanaged secrets in your code, letting you know if there are any sensitive credentials that might be used to gain access to your infrastructure.

## Next steps

While it's impossible to prepare for every troubleshooting scenario you may encounter in your infrastructure, having a design with reliability in mind and a solid strategy to diagnose potential issues can help reduce downtime and improve the experience for your users. By using Terraform, Consul, and Vault, you can build reliable infrastructure, monitor for potential issues, and get ahead of problems before they affect production.
