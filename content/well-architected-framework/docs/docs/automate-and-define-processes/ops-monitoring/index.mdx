This guide describes the best practices for monitoring your infrastructure and services. Monitoring your infrastructure and services lets you maintain their reliability, performance, and security. You can use what you learn here to continuously observe key metrics such as resource usage, response times and error rates, to proactively identify and fix problems before they impact users. 

There are three main steps to monitoring your infrastructure:

- Identify the key metrics relevant to your infrastructure and services.
- Install and set up monitoring agents to collect metrics and logs.
- Create dashboards to view the metrics and set up alerts to notify you of issues.

This guide recommends which metrics to monitor, how to properly configure and deploy your monitoring agents, and how to set up dashboard and alerts. Following these recommendations helps you standardize and automate your entire monitoring process across your organization.

<Tip> 

While monitoring agents can collect some metrics automatically, obtaining comprehensive telemetry data often requires instrumenting your application code directly. To understand how to implement instrumentation, refer to [How OpenTelemetry facilitates instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/).
