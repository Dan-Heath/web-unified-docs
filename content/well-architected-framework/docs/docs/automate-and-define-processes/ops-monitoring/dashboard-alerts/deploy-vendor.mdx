page_title: Deploy vendor monitoring tools
description: TODO
---

Terraform makes it easy to deploy and manage various vendor monitoring tools through official providers and modules. Terraform has over 200 partner and community providers for logging and monitoring — some popular ones include DataDog, New Relic, Grafana, and Splunk. With these providers, you can automatically provision the monitoring tool, and its resources like dashboard alerts.

Many monitoring vendors also contribute to OpenTelemetry (OTel). OpenTelemetry provides a standardized way to generate and export telemetry data like metrics, traces, and logs from your applications. The OpenTelemetry agent collects this data from your applications. Instead of deploying separate agents for each vendor monitoring tool, you can configure the OTel agent to export data to multiple backends simultaneously. For example, you can send metrics to Datadog, traces to Honeycomb, and logs to Splunk from the same Otel agent.

With Terraform, you have a unified approach to manage and operate all different monitoring systems through a single, automated workflow defined in code. Terraform lets you define the exact configuration you want for everything – from the OpenTelemetry agents collecting data (Refer to GCE example in external resources) to backend monitoring tools like DataDog, New Relic, Grafana, and others.

HashiCorp resources:

  - The [Terraform Datadog provider](/terraform/tutorials/applications/datadog-provider) tutorial guides you through how to use Terraform to deploy an application in EKS and install the DataDog agent across the Kubernetes cluster.
  - Terraform Registry hosts over 200 [Logging and Monitoring](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers?category=logging-monitoring) partner and community providers. You should be able to find a provider to manage your monitoring tool of choice. This includes popular providers such as the [New Relic Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs) and [DataDog Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/DataDog/datadog/latest/docs).

### Deploy cloud native

Many cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offer their own monitoring services, which can effectively monitor infrastructure metrics and application logs. With Terraform, you can use cloud provider resources and specific monitoring modules to deploy and manage your cloud-native monitoring infrastructure without installing additional monitoring agents.

HashiCorp resources:

  - AWS maintains the [AWS Integration and Automation (IA) Terraform modules](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/aws-ia) - the [`cloudwatch-log-group`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aws-ia/cloudwatch-log-group/aws/latest) module deploys and manages an AWS Cloudwatch log group along with the corresponding IAM permissions. The [Terraform AWS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs) contains CloudWatch resources that Terraform can create and manage such as the [`aws_cloudwatch_dashboard`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/cloudwatch_dashboard) resource. 
  - Azure maintains [Azure Verified Modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/terraform/tf-resource-modules/#available-modules) - the [avm-res-operationalinsights-workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-operationalinsights-workspace/azurerm/latest) module deploys and manages a Log Analytics Workspace with reasonable defaults. The [Azure Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) contains the resources you need to deploy monitoring for your application in Azure such as [`azurerm_portal_dashboard`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/portal_dashboard) and [`azurerm_monitor_metric_alert`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/monitor_metric_alert).  
  - Google maintains a [cloud operations module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-operations/google/latest) that manages Google Cloud's operations suite (Cloud Logging and Monitoring). The [Terraform Google Cloud provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs) page provides Google Cloud Monitoring resources that Terraform can create and manage such as the [`google_monitoring_dashboard`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/monitoring_dashboard) resource. 

External resources:

  - Andrei Maksimov's [tutorial with a video](https://hands-on.cloud/terraform-cloudwatch-examples/) guides you through how to automate alarms, dashboards, and logs in the AWS CloudWatch service.
  - Azure's [Multi-cloud monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-multicloud) article guides you through setting up Azure Monitor to monitor your services and infrastructure across different clouds, and ingest cloud native metrics and telemetry information into your existing monitoring solution.
