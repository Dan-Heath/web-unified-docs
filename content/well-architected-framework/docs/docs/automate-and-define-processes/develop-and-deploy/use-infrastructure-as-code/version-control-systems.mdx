# Version control systems

Version control systems (VCS), such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, allow you to store and version your code. VCS fosters collaboration by making it easy to share and collaborate on code with peers. Terraform can manage the installation and configuration of on-prem VSC systems and configure VCS as a service. 

Automating VCS configuration with Terraform improves the reliability and security of your infrastructure by applying the same controls you use for managing applications and infrastructure. By managing your VCS as code, you can reduce manual configuration errors, integrate VCS configuration into CI/CD, and enforce security best practices at a granular level.

Benefits of using Terraform:
- Set default branches and branch protections
- Create branches and repositories
- Manage code releases
- Create and manage security controls, users, and groups
- Install and configure your VCS in the cloud and on-prem

HashiCorp provides GitHub Actions that integrate with the HCP Terraform API. These actions let you create your own custom CI/CD workflows to meet your organization's needs.

In this section of how to [Use infrastructure as code](/well-architected-framework/automate-and-define-processes#use-infrastructure-as-code), you learned how you can manage version control systems using IaC and Terraform. Use infrastructure as code is part of the [Automate and define processes pillar](/well-architected-framework/automate-and-define-processes).
