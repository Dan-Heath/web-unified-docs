# Overview

When you establish operational excellence, you enable your team to focus on development by creating safe, consistent, and reliable workflows for deployment. Standardized processes allow teams to work efficiently and more easily adapt to changes in technology or business requirements.

Manual provisioning infrastructure is risky, inefficient, and difficult to scale. Operator error is inevitable, and while you can create audit logs of user actions, it can be hard to diagnose failures. As your organization grows, there will be a higher volume of changes to monitor and deploy, and manual processes will slow your development velocity. By standardizing on best practices and automating repeated workflows, you can more safely and efficiently introduce changes to your infrastructure.
 
This guide will provide you with best practices and resources for achieving operational excellence. You will learn why you should incorporate infrastructure as code, version control, reusable components, atomic infrastructure, standard workflows, and planning for scale to accelerate your development process.
