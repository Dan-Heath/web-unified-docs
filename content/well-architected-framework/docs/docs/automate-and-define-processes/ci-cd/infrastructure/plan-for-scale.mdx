# Plan for scale

You should plan for variations in capacity and traffic by automating scaling events. By using monitoring and alerting to track your infrastructure and service resource usage, you can proactively and dynamically respond to varying demands for your services, ensuring more reliability and resilience.

Most major cloud providers have native auto-scaling features. You can use Terraform to manage the autoscaling configurations through the auto-scaling resources, such as the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource.

Monitoring cost is an important factor when planning for scale. HashiCorp's Sentinel is a policy-as-code framework that allows you to introduce logic-based policy decisions to your systems. Codifying your policies offers the same benefits as IaC, allowing for collaborative development, visibility, and predictability in your operations. You can use Sentinel to help manage your infrastructure spending.
