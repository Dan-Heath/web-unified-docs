Your application needs to know how to talk to other services on the network. As application architecture becomes more distributed, it can be challenging to configure and maintain communication between applications and services. As your application scales, it may be more difficult to troubleshoot issues and balance traffic to multiple instances of your services.

[Consul](/consul) is a networking solution that lets you securely connect your services and manage traffic.

If you already have existing solutions to collect and monitor metrics in your organization, Consul and many other HashiCorp tools can integrate with existing solutions. For example, if your metrics solution requires an agent to be installed on the machine your application runs on, you can use Packer to create a golden image that includes the agent, ensuring that every application that you build automatically collects and sends metrics.
