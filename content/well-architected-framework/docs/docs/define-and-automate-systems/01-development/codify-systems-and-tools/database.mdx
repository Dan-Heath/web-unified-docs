# Database components and systems

Terraform can deploy, manage, and interact with database management systems. You can use cloud providers, like AWS, GCP, or Azure, to deploy database services such as RDS, and vendor providers to deploy databases like Cockroach, and MongoDB.

Terraform offers features beyond just deploying databases. It can manage database schemas, allowing you to version control database structures. You can also manage user permissions, providing consistent access controls across different environments. Terraform can also handle cross-database operations like creating read replicas or configuring cross-database access. It can also manage integrations of your database with other services, such as communication with VMs. 

Upon database creation, you can also data seed your database, which is great for creating test environments that DBAs can quickly use. With IaC, you can make sure you're seeding the same data across multiple environments, which will increase the reliability of your tests, as you know your data will be consistent.

Benefits of using Terraform:
- Automate seed and migrate data during database deployment
- Provision and configure database instances
- Manage cross-database and service integrations 
- Automate backup plans in multi-cloud/region

## Next steps

In this section of how to [Use infrastructure as code](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes#use-infrastructure-as-code), you learned how you can deploy, manage, and interact with database management systems using IaC and Terraform. Use infrastructure as code is part of the [Define and automate processes pillar](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes).
