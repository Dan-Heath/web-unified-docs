# Container orchestration

Terraform can automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of orchestration systems. These systems range from self-managed and cloud-managed orchestrators like Nomad and Kubernetes to cloud-native container services like AWS ECS.

We recommend you separate the configuration to deploy, configure, and manage the orchestrator from the configuration to deploy services to the orchestrator. For example, you would have Terraform deploy your Kubernetes system in one configuration and then deploy services like NGINX in a different configuration.

## Kubernetes 

Terraform allows you to manage Kubernetes as infrastructure as code.  It can create and manage cloud resources such as virtual machines, networks, load balancers, and storage systems across various cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. For example, on AWS, Terraform can set up an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster, configure VPCs, subnets, and security groups, and provision EC2 instances to serve as worker nodes. 

Terraform can interact directly with Kubernetes to manage cluster resources. Terraform can use the Kubernetes provider to create and manage namespaces, deploy workloads, set up services, and configure ingress rules. It can also handle more complex Kubernetes concepts like role-based access control (RBAC) by enabling you to set up roles, role bindings, and service accounts.

While self-managed Kubernetes is the **Container orchestration** category in the Terraform Registry, the cloud-managed versions are in the cloud-specific provider documentation. For example, the AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) documentation is in the AWS provider documentation under `aws_eks_cluster`.

Benefits of using Terraform:
- Deploy orchestrator to multiple environments
- Manage container workloads
- Manage orchestrator configuration with IaC
- Manage hardware orchestrator runs on
