# Public cloud and cloud automation

Terraform integrates into most major clouds, including AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle, VMWare, and OVHcloud. These cloud providers give you the resources to create a full cloud stack that's ready to run your application. Cloud automation providers give you specialized cloud functions, and generally will not provide you with all the resources that the major cloud providers will. These providers include Helm, F5, Ansible, and more. A common pattern is to review the cloud documentation to determine what cloud infrastructure you want to deploy, and then refer to the provider documentation to learn which resource you should use.

You can also visit the cloud provider modules. These modules give you pre-written code that you can use to deploy your infrastructure. For example, you can use the AWS S3-bucket module to deploy an S3 bucket by only passing in the required variable and authenticating to AWS.

In this section of how to [Use infrastructure as code](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes#use-infrastructure-as-code), you learned how you can deploy and manage infrastructure in public clouds and cloud automation tools using IaC and Terraform. Use infrastructure as code is part of the [Define and automate processes pillar](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes).
