# Continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD)

When you use Terraform to manage your CI/CD, you are able to manage the CI/CD system's configuration through version control and create a defined approval process for system modifications.

An example is managing CI/CD build agents. CI/CD systems use build agents to run jobs like building software, or deploying infrastructure. CI/CD tools, like GitHub and GitLab, often offer build agents as a service, meaning they manage the build agent for you. However, you can manage the build agents yourself, which gives you control of hardware, operating system, and software tools. Packer can create an image and install the agent and other software. The build agent image can be a VM image or a container. Terraform can then create the build infrastructure, whether it's VMs or container clusters, and deploy your build agents. 

Terraform can manage other components of your CI/CD systems. As CI/CD systems are vital to your organization's operational excellence, managing these systems as code will increase their reliability and security by adding a defined approval process audit logs for configuration changes.

Benefits of using Terraform:
- Configure build agents and build infrastructure
- Setup CI/CD in dev, staging, and production environments
- Manage security and IAM as code
- Manage build tokens and keys
- Create approval process and audit logs for configuration changes
