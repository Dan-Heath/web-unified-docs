# Identify reusable components

If you repeatedly provision the same group of resources, you can refactor your configuration to use reusable collections instead. Reusable collections of components reduce the time it takes to deploy infrastructure by allowing developers to reuse configuration instead of writing it from scratch. Developers can also design reusable collections to comply with organizational best practices and security guidelines.

Defining reusable collections of components, such as Terraform modules, also reduces your time to provision, giving engineers a configurable way to deploy commonly used resources. You can adapt these components to account for changes to service demand,  modify them based on failure modes, and release updates to allow downstream users to deploy your updated configuration.

A Terraform module is a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory. Modules are reusable and customizable; you can wrap modules with configurations to fit your organization's standards. Creating a more modular infrastructure encourages your organization to decouple services by helping you focus on logically related resources. Decoupling can reduce the scope of failure and enable more efficient deployment due to reduced system dependencies.

For example, if your team manages object storage for multiple applications that all follow your organization's common standards, such as security or lifecycle management, you can use an object storage Terraform module for your cloud providers. The object storage module can contain configuration such as lifecycle policies, or security standards. You can store and version the module in a version control repository or Terraform registry and share it across your organization for developers to access.

Machine images can also benefit from following a reusable component workflow, commonly called a golden image. A golden image is an image on top of which developers can build applications, letting them focus on the application itself instead of system dependencies and patches. A typical golden image includes a common system, logging and monitoring tools, recent security patches, and application dependencies.

You can create a golden image with Packer and make it available for your developers and operations teams. These teams can then use Packer to ingest the golden image and install their applications and other dependencies before deploying the image with tools like Terraform. You can integrate this process with a CI/CD system to create a complete application deployment workflow for deploying to your cloud infrastructure. You can also use this workflow for containers.

If you have common infrastructure that your developers use to deploy their applications, you can use HCP Waypoint to accelerate deployments. Waypoint templates allow platform engineers to pre-define infrastructure in a Terraform no-code module. You can create a template with common infrastructure that complies with your organization's security, finance, scaling, and other policies.

For example, a template can consist of a code repository template configured with your organization's default frontend framework, linting libraries, and CI/CD pipelines. A developer could use the Waypoint template to deploy their application and know that the underlying infrastructure is configured correctly. Other template examples include a production-ready Kubernetes cluster or backend API framework configured for serverless.
