## Next steps

In this section of [Develop and test](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/develop-and-test), you learned best practices for integrating your deployments into a CI/CD pipeline. Develop and test is part of the [Define and automate processes pillar](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes).
