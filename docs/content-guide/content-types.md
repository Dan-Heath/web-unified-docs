# Content types

HashiCorp product documentation uses the following content types:

- **Explanation**

  - **Concept**: Concept pages describe constructs and abstractions associated
    with the product. For the purpose of segmenting information into types,
    internals, subjects, and features are synonymous with concepts.

    Example:

    - [HCP Consul cluster management](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/cluster-management)

  - **Overview**:  Overview pages are section landing pages that funnel users to
    more detailed usage, reference, or concept pages. Overviews bridge the gap
    between usage and concept pages by describing workflows and introducing
    vocabulary that help users understand a topic area more broadly.

    Example:

    - [HCP Consul Dedicated cluster overview](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/consul/dedicated)

- **Usage (how-to guide)**: Usage pages describe a single procedure or a
  tightly-coupled set of procedures that enable you to perform a unit of work.
  Unlike tutorials, usage pages do not provide code or instructions for creating
  an operating environment.

  Example:

  - [HCP Consul secure cluster access with IP allowlist](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/consul/secure/ip-allowlist)

- **Tutorial**: Tutorials demonstrate how to use product features and
  capabilities to complete a goal. They contain end-to-end scenarios and include
  code for instantiating environments so that the tutorial can quickly and
  clearly demonstrate the value of a feature or set of features. Education
  Engineers create and manage tutorial content.

  Examples:

  - [AI workloads on Nomad](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials/ai-workloads)
  - [Database credential management](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/db-credentials)

- **Reference**: config, CLI, API

wiki](https://hashicorp.atlassian.net/wiki/x/eYBVnw) for detailed explanations.
